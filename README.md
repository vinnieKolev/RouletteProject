## Game Play

The implementation follows the official casino rules of Roulette with a wheel
that conforms to the American Roulette wheel layout. Roulette is a game in which
players place bets on where a ball will land on a circular wheel that contains
dozens of different numbered pockets. On an American roulette wheel layout,
there are 38 pockets in total: the numbers 1-36, as well as 0 (zero) and 00
(double zero). Bets can vary, from betting on single number, color of a pocket,
or a combination of numbers, where the combinations can cover:
1. Pair, triple, or quartet of numbers positioned next to each other on the
   number mat.
1. The set of even or odd numbers.
1. The set of low (1-18) or high (19-36) numbers.
1. The green numbers (0, 00).

Each type of bet carries a different risk and therefore a different reward. The
lower the odds of the bet hitting the higher the payout is if the bet hits.

## How to Run

As our project is an Android Application, it will run on Android Studio,
the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating
system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for
Android development. Also, the project requires an emulator which will enable
the computer system to behave like an Android, and run Roulette smoothly.
1. Download and  install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).
1. Clone [RouletteProject](https://github.com/dpgrrant/RouletteProject/tree/master).
1. Open `RouletteProject` in Android Studio.
1. Select an Android device/emulator in Android Studio. If an Android Runtime
   and Emulator(s) have not been downloaded, Android Studio will lead through
   the workflow of installing a runtime and an emulator.
1. Run the Application.
